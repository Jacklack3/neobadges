### Quick note for devs:

If you plan on doing any work on BadgeBot, make a file called `config.js` in the `modules` folder, and put this in it:
```js
module.exports = {
  discordKey: 'DISCORD_KEY_HERE'
};
```
You can make your own testing bot and use their key, or ask me for BadgeBot's key on Discord.
